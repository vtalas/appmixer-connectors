### Desired Attribute Order in component.json

1. `name`
2. `description`
3. `author`
4. `version`
5. `auth`
6. `quota`
7. `inPorts`
8. `properties`
9. `outPorts`
10. `icon`

### Type Mapping for Input Ports

Ensure `inPorts[0].schema.properties.<input_name>.type` and `inPorts[0].inspector.inputs.<input_name>.type` match:
- `string` → `text` or `textarea`
- `string` with `format: "date-time"` → `date-time`
- `string` with `format: "date"` → `date-time` with `config: { enableTime: false }`
- `integer` → `number`
- `boolean` → `toggle`

### Output Port Schema Definition

Each output port can define its output structure using **either** `schema` or `options`, but **not both**:

- **`schema`**: Use JSON Schema to define the structure of output data. Provides type information and validation.
- **`options`**: Use an array of label/value pairs to define available output fields. Simpler but less structured.

**IMPORTANT**: You cannot have both `schema` and `options` at the root level of an output port. Choose one approach:

```json
// CORRECT - using schema only
"outPorts": [
    {
        "name": "out",
        "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "id": { "type": "string", "title": "ID" },
                "name": { "type": "string", "title": "Name" }
            }
        }
    }
]

// CORRECT - using options only
"outPorts": [
    {
        "name": "out",
        "options": [
            { "label": "ID", "value": "id" },
            { "label": "Name", "value": "name" }
        ]
    }
]

// INCORRECT - both schema and options
"outPorts": [
    {
        "name": "out",
        "schema": { ... },
        "options": [ ... ]  // ERROR: Cannot have both
    }
]
```
