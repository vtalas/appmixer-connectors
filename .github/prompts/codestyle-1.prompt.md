# Appmixer Connector Code Style Guide
For component(s) in a given Appmixer connector:
Read both the component.json and the behavior file (the .js file with the same name as the component directory).

# Refactor the component.json file to follow these rules
Every update and delete component must have `outPorts: ['out']` in the component.json.
Every update and delete component must have at least one required input, which is the `id` of the entity being updated or deleted.
Avoid changing `icon`.
Every inspector input of type `toggle` must have a `defaultValue` set to `false` if not specified otherwise.
For components that define dynamic output ports (i.e., source is present inside an outPorts entry), ensure that the source.data.messages mapping follows this rule: If the input schema defines required fields (i.e., the "required" array is non-empty), then all required fields must be mapped using "in/<fieldName>": "any" (the value can be any valid expression or constant). If there are no required input fields, only include the minimal mapping: "in/outputType": "inputs/in/outputType". Do not include any additional mappings when no required fields are present. This ensures correct evaluation of dynamic output port options.

# Refactor the behavior file to follow these rules
The file begins with `'use strict';` (single quotes) on the first line. Optional: various ESlint rules can be on the first line with "use strict"; on the next line.
Ensure an empty line after the receive function signature definition (i.e., after the `async receive(context) {` line).
Avoid adding any unspecified empty lines in the behavior file.
Remove any unused library imports or requires.
When making HTTP requests with context.httpRequest, prefer destructuring the response as const { data } = await context.httpRequest({ ... }) instead of const response = await context.httpRequest({ ... }).
Apply these changes to all components for the connector if not specified otherwise.
Avoid `json: true` in the context.httpRequest options, as it is not needed.
Avoid `'Content-Type': 'application/json'` in the headers of context.httpRequest, as it is not needed.
Every required input in the component.json must be also asserted in the behavior file. If missing, throw exception with `throw new context.CancelError('<human_readable_input_name> is required!')`.
Every update and delete component must return an empty object, eg `return context.sendJson({}, 'out');` at the end of the function.
